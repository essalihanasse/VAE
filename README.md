# Variational Autoencoder Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as described in "An Introduction to Variational Autoencoders." The implementation demonstrates the core concepts of VAEs including the encoder-decoder architecture, latent space representation, and the reparameterization trick.

## Overview

Variational Autoencoders are deep learning models that learn to encode data into a compressed latent representation and then decode it back to reconstruct the original input. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs learn a probabilistic mapping that enables both data compression and generation of new samples.

Key features of this implementation:
- Encoder network that maps input data to latent space parameters (μ and σ)
- Reparameterization trick for backpropagation through random sampling
- Decoder network that reconstructs input data from latent representations
- Implementation of the VAE loss function (reconstruction loss + KL divergence)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vae-implementation.git
cd vae-implementation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/model_config.yaml
```

4. Generate samples:
```bash
python src/generate.py --model-path checkpoints/model.pth
```

## Model Architecture

The VAE consists of two main components:

1. **Encoder**: Neural network that maps input data x to parameters μ and σ of the latent distribution q(z|x).
2. **Decoder**: Neural network that reconstructs input data from samples of the latent distribution p(x|z).

The model is trained to minimize:
- Reconstruction loss (how well the decoder reconstructs the input)
- KL divergence between q(z|x) and the prior p(z)

## Training

The training script supports various hyperparameters that can be configured in the config file:

- Latent dimension size
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Number of epochs
- Beta parameter for KL divergence weight
- Network architecture (layer sizes, activation functions)

## Results

Example reconstructions and generated samples will be saved in the `results/` directory during training. The model's performance can be evaluated using:

- Reconstruction quality
- Generated sample quality
- Latent space interpolation
- Disentanglement of latent features
